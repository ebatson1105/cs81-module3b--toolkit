After testing some of the modified versions of the functions, including Square(), isEven(), isOdd(), multiply(), etc, I realize that it is easy to set a functions parameters (ie, what to do with the number value that is input into the function) and easily get it to calculate the way you want it to. 

The square() function allows you to square the entered value, that is, multiply it by itself. Multiply(), similarly multiples the given value, but not by itself, rather by whatever other value you set. isEven() and isOdd() are both ways to specify which number values, even or odd, should be utilized in the function. 


After working through some of the technical problems with getting started, I began to see that functions follow certain patterns with how they are implemented in your project. For instance, you can copy and paste certain portions of the code which are re-used across functions, for ease of use, such as in the function function 

isEven(number) {
  return number % 2 === 0;
}

Which can easily be modified to include odd numbers instead of even, when specified.

I began to learn how much logical thought goes into programming, once the syntax is learned. You can formulate an idea of what you want the function to do, and can reasonably expect errors if the logic doesn't make sense,  such as when you ask the function to divide by 0, or something similar. 

I can easily see this type of toolkit being used in the real-world, for many different purposes. Whether it be calculating grades for a teacher, or running simulations of flight patterns or video gaming, it's incredibly useful to be able to easily set and test functions.
